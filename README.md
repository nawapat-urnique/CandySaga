# CandySaga

- When run, a grid of colored squares should be displayed.
- The grid is of arbitrary size and each square is of a random color from an arbitrary-sized pool of colors. 
- The player should be able to swap any two adjacent squares.
- If the swap results in three or more squares of the same color lining up, all squares involved in the match are removed and squared above them drop to take their place.
- When gaps are left at the top, new randomly-colored squares are created to fill the gaps.
- If the swap does not result in any matches, the swapped tiles are swapped back automatically.
- The swap and/or drop can result in additional matches.
- A single square can be involved in both row and column in one match, in which case all squares involved in all matches are removed.
